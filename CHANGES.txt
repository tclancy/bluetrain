v0.9.6.3, 8/20/2012 Still trying to get the subdirectories included. PEP 8 style compliance.
v0.9.7, 8/20/2012 Actually got it to work. Removed base.html as user should provide this.
v0.9.7.1, 8/20/2012 Fixed packages list now that I've got things (hopefully) working.
v0.9.7.2, 8/20/2012 Still hates me.
v0.9.7.3, 8/20/2012 Could it be? Feels like I've got 6 redundant declarations to include the stuff.
v0.9.7.4, 8/20/2012 It wasn't. Maybe this time.
v0.9.7.5, 8/20/2012 You wish stupid.
v0.9.7.6, 8/20/2012 I think I'll stop updating this until it works, ok?
v0.9.8.0, 8/20/2012 Seems to be working, but had to fix a typo
